**OpenCal** is a modern, open-source web application that simplifies and streamlines the process of scheduling
appointments.
Itâ€™s ideal for anyone who organizes meetings and wants to save time, whether they are self-employed, part of a
team or employed by a company.
Due to its open license, OpenCal can be used, customized, and self-hosted free of charge. It is also suitable for
professional and commercial use in businesses.

The backend is written in Symfony and the API Platform, and it provides a RESTful API that the Vue front end uses. The
API can also be integrated into other software applications.
